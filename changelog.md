Minor updates to the UM data:
  * Fixed parent FEM recovery point for static bending and torsion (was 44% chord rather than 50% chord)
  * Fixed post-processing issue in parent FEM twist recovery for static torsion
  * Adjusted SOL 400 deformed modal analysis convergence threshold for consistency
  * Adjusted tip loss factor in UM/NAST static aeroelastics to exact values from UM/NAST vs. SOL 400-VLM tip displacement error minimization
