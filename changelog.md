# Changelog

# [1.2.1](https://github.com/ngoiz/pazy-aepw3-results/tree/1.2.1) (2021-10-11)

SHARPy deformed flutter data included for Angles of Attack 6 and 7 degrees

# [1.2](https://github.com/ngoiz/pazy-aepw3-results/tree/1.2) (2021-06-14)

This new release includes the latest MRM results simulating the deformed flutter test of the Pre-Pazy wing

# [1.0.1](https://github.com/ngoiz/pazy-aepw3-results/tree/v1.0.1) (2020-12-08)

Minor updates to the UM data:
  * Fixed parent FEM recovery point for static bending and torsion (was 44% chord rather than 50% chord)
  * Fixed post-processing issue in parent FEM twist recovery for static torsion
  * Adjusted SOL 400 deformed modal analysis convergence threshold for consistency
  * Adjusted tip loss factor in UM/NAST static aeroelastics to exact values from UM/NAST vs. SOL 400-VLM tip displacement error minimization
