Results for simulations/experiments conducted on the Pazy wing.

The results are presented in Jupyter notebooks in the respective folders which you should be able to view from within Github.

Currently available:
  
  * `01_Bending`: static bending experimental and computational comparison. Mass placed mid-chord at the wing-tip
  * `02_Torsion`: static twisting experimental and computational comparison. Mass placed 80mm ahead of leading edge at the wing-tip
  
## Contributing

Feel free to add your own set of results. From the Jupyter notebook file in each of the tests it should be fairly straight forward to add any new cases. If you do, please make sure that the data you add requires no post-processing in order to keep the files as clean as possible.
